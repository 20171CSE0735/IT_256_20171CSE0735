Referred to by fans and media as Thalapathy (commander), Vijay is the highest paid actor and one of the most significant figures in the industry.[3] By 2017, he became the second-highest grossing actor in Tamil cinema history, behind Rajinikanth.[4] As of 2019, Vijay has acted in 64 films as a lead actor and won numerous awards including three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, eight Vijay Awards, an Indiatoday Award, SIIMA Award, Cosmopolitan Award and National Film Award UK, three Edison Awards and two Vikatan Awards.

He has been included five times in the Forbes India Celebrity 100 list, based on the earnings of Indian celebrities.

At 10 years old, Vijay's first role was in the drama Vetri (1984); he continued to perform as a child artist in films until Ithu Engal Neethi (1988), directed by his father S. A. Chandrasekhar. He then featured as the lead in Naalaiya Theerpu (1992), again directed by his father. He received his breakthrough in the film Poove Unakkaga (1996), which was directed by Vikraman.[5] Vijay began the new millennium with successful films such as Kushi and Priyamaanavale.[6] The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003), where he was paired opposite Jyothika, changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero.[7] He appeared next as a kabaddi player opposite Trisha in Dharani's Ghilli (2004), which went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year and the first Tamil film to earn ₹500 million (Indian rupees).[8] His performance in Thirupaachi (2005) earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize.[9] Vijay continued to achieve commercial success during the 2000s with films including Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007).

In 2011, Vijay's career prospects improved after he was praised for his role as a bodyguard in Kaavalan.[10] The following year he appeared in two films: as a college student in Nanban and an army officer in Thuppakki. His performances in both films received positive critical feedback.[11] He followed that with A. L. Vijay's Thalaivaa (2013) and the multi-starrer Jilla (2014). Again, he teamed up with AR Murugadoss for the action film Kaththi (2014) where he had played dual roles as a thief and an idealist. It became one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of 2014.[12] In 2016, he played a police officer in Atlee Kumar's Theri which had one of the biggest openings in Tamil cinema, grossing ₹1.5—1.56 billion worldwide, and is among the highest-grossing Tamil films of all time.[13] He played triple roles for the first time in the film Mersal (2017), his second collaboration with Atlee.[14] It became the highest-grossing film of Vijay's career and was also released in Japan in four major cities: Tokyo, Ebina, Osako and Nakaya. </p>

Chandrasekhar is a Tamil film director and his mother Shoba is a playback singer and carnatic vocalist. He had a sister Vidhya, who died when she was two years old.
